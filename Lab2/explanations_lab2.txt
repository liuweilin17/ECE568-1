Server:
Firstly, it will build a SSL context object. We will initialize it with the server's key and password and configurate the server. Then we set the Key, CA, verifying option, cipher list and verification mode. Next, we will create a TCP connection with handshakes. Every client connect to the server, a child process on server side will be forked to handle each client requests. After that, we will check the certification of the SSL information. If the certicication is verified, we will show the client informations. Otherwise, we will handle the errors such as not-support-protocol, invalid certicication and etc..

Client:
Firstly, it initialize a SSL context object, and set a proper key, configuration. Then we will build a TCP connection to server and handshake with email and CN. Also, it will handle the different error such as the mismatch of email or CN. Client side has similar process as Server side. After cliend send a resquest and get a response, it will be terminated.
